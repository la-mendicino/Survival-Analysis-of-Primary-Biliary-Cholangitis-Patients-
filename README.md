# Survival-Analysis-of-Primary-Biliary-Cholangitis-Patients-

In this project, I use the Primary Biliary Cirhosis (PBC) data set from the Mayo Clinic trial conducted between the years 1974 to 1984. PBC is an autoimmune disease leading to destruction of the small bile ducts in the liver. I first do exploratory data analysis, providing summary statistics of the baseline factors and an assessment of normality with density plots and normality statistics. I assess log transformations of numerical factors here. Next, I employ a standard Cox regression model for survival with each factor as a predictor. I then use LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) to identify a parsimonious set of variables to predict survival. I do this using the data set as it is, then using log transformed factors. I propose the model I believe best predicts survival. Then, I assess non-linear associations between the factors and the time to event outcome by inspecting the functional form of continuous variables against martingale residuals and then splines to assess nonlinear terms. Lastly, I provide survival curves of the models and a summary about the results of my analysis.
